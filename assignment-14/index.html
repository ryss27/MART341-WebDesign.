<h3>
    About the band
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The band originally came together after Julien Baker met Lucy Dacus at a show where they instantly clicked. A month later, Lucy, Phoebe, and Julien found out they would all soon be touring together. This is when they started writing together.</li>
    <li>The band's name reflects a critisim on patriacharl manifestations about how men are rewarded and applauded for nearly every move they make, whereas women have to jump through a significant more amount of hoops often for half the recognition. </li>
    <li>The band now has two albums, an EP and a full album recently released, The Record </li>
    <li>This website will help should you explore the band! </li>
</ul>
